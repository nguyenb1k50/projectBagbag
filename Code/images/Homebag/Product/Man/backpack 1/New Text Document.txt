DOLCE & GABBANA
printed Vulcano backpack
$956


Dolce & Gabbana’s AW18 menswear collection, entitled ‘King’s Angels’ is synonymous with supreme opulence and extravagance. Dynasty dress is mismatched with collegiate separates and cherub embellished bombers—the result is regal renaissance-inspired streetwear mixed with baroque-style tailoring. This multicolour printed Vulcano backpack is crafted from leather and features a round top handle, adjustable shoulder straps, a top zip fastening, a front zip pocket, a main internal compartment and an internal zipped pocket.

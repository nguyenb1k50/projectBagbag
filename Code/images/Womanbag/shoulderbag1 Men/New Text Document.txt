GUCCI
Shoulder bag with panther face appliqué

The world of nature is an endless source of inspiration for the Gucci narrative, made up of animals of all species and mysterious creatures. A recurring motif in the Pre-Fall 2018 collection, the panther face is here embroidered and applied onto a black canvas crossbody bag. Designed with a sporty feel, the accessory is completed with a Web shoulder strap in nylon. Black canvas with embroidered panther face appliqué. Palladium-toned hardware. Metal feline head detail. Green and red Web strap. Interior open pocket. Adjustable shoulder strap with 20" drop. Zipper closure. W7.5" x H5.5" x D2.5". Nylon lining. Made in Italy.

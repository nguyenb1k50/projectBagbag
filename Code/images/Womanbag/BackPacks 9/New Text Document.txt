Designer Backstory
No one does opulent Italian fashion quite like Versace. Bold patterns and clashing colours made Gianni Versace famous; today it’s his sister Donatella’s impeccable tailoring and glamorous evening-wear that keeps the brand in the spotlight. Since its establishment in 1978, Versace has come to be one of the most recognisable brands in the world.
